/**
 * Types for offline (air-gapped) transaction preparation and signing.
 *
 * The flow this models has three hosts, which may be three machines:
 *
 *  1. **Preparer** (online) builds an unsigned transaction and emits a
 *     self-describing, integrity-checked {@link OfflineSigningArtifact}.
 *  2. **Reviewer/signer** (offline) verifies the artifact, renders a
 *     human-readable {@link ArtifactReview}, and produces an
 *     {@link OfflineSignature} without any network access.
 *  3. **Submitter** (online) merges the collected signatures and submits.
 *
 * Everything here is plain JSON so artifacts can cross an air gap as a file
 * or QR code, and every stage can independently verify it was not tampered
 * with in transit.
